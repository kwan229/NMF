NMF Algorithms On ORL and YaleB Data

In this project, two Non-negative Matrix Factorization(NMF) algorithms with two large-magnitude noise datasets to recognize face images are performed. 

The two NMF algorithms’ robustness when the dataset contains a large noise or corruption are analyzed and compared. 
Add a block-occlusion noise to two real-world face image datasets (the ORL dataset and the Extended YaleB dataset) and use them to apply NMF and L2,1-Norm Based NMF algorithms. 
Then, these two different NMF algorithms’ performance and robustness are compared using two evaluated metrics (the Relative Reconstruction Errors and the Average Accuracy).
